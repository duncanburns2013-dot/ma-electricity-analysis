## The Gaslighting: What They Say vs Reality

![Gaslighting Chart](charts/chart2_gaslighting_growth.png)

### What State Legislators Claim:
> "Mass Save is a much smaller percentage of the bill compared to what is being driven by Eversource and National Grid"  
> — Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven (D-Somerville)

### The Reality:

| Component | Growth Since 2014 |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Policy Mandates** | **+293%** |
| Utility Costs | +48% |
| Inflation | +32% |

**Policy mandates grew 9x faster than inflation.**

### Bill Composition (Verified):
- **Utility Profit:** ~10% of bill (regulated margin)
- **Policy Mandates:** 17% of bill (labeled "Public Benefits")

## The Gaslighting Exposed

### What Governor Healey Offers:
- ✓ One-time $220M bill credit (~$76/household)
- ✓ "Get a Mass Save audit!" (funded by the surcharge on your bill)
- ✓ "Apply for LIHEAP!" (if you qualify)
- ✓ Heat pump rebates (if you can afford upfront cost)

### What Would Actually Help (But They Refuse):
- Cap Mass Save spending
- Reform RPS multipliers
- Consolidate solar subsidy programs
- Review RGGI costs
- **Allow pipeline infrastructure**

### The Math:
- **Healey's "relief":** $76 one-time
- **Annual policy charges:** $420-$1,740/year (ONGOING)

*"Despite constant talk about affordability, Beacon Hill has yet to deliver meaningful action that lowers supply costs, delivery charges, or public benefit fees. If Beacon Hill can't do that, then we don't just need energy reform, we need a government reset in the 2026 election."*
