# Massachusetts Electricity Costs: Solutions Analysis
## A Practical Roadmap to Lower Rates

---

## Executive Summary

Massachusetts ratepayers face electricity costs 57% higher than the national average due to $4.4 billion in annual policy mandates. However, **practical legislative reforms could reduce costs by $2-3 billion per year**, saving the average household **$600-900 annually** and bringing MA rates closer to national competitiveness.

**This is achievable through three categories of reform:**
1. Immediate relief (6-12 months)
2. Structural reforms (1-2 years)  
3. Long-term strategy (3-5 years)

## The Problem in Three Numbers

| Metric | Current Reality | Impact |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Annual Policy Costs** | $4.4 billion | 29% of every bill |
| **vs. National Average** | +57% higher | +$1,188/year per household |
| **Rate Growth Since 2014** | +46% | 2.5x faster than inflation |

**Root Cause:** These are legislative mandates, not utility management issues. The solution must come from the legislature.

---

## Solution Framework

### Category 1: Immediate Relief (6-12 months)
**Goal:** Stop the bleeding, create accountability

**Actions:**
- ✅ Pass transparency legislation requiring annual cost-benefit reports
- ✅ Implement affordability metrics (max 3% of income for energy)
- ✅ Freeze Mass Save budget at current levels
- ✅ Conduct comprehensive audit of all programs

**Potential Savings:** $500-800M/year  
**Difficulty:** Low to Moderate  
**Bill Impact:** -$15-25/month per household

### Category 2: Structural Reform (1-2 years)
**Goal:** Fix the broken incentive structures

**Actions:**
- ✅ Cap Mass Save at $1.0B annually (down from $1.5B)
- ✅ Reform RPS multipliers to align with actual generation
- ✅ Consolidate overlapping solar programs (SMART, net metering, RECs)
- ✅ Review RGGI participation cost-effectiveness

**Potential Savings:** $1.0-1.5B/year  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Bill Impact:** -$35-50/month per household

### Category 3: Long-Term Strategy (3-5 years)
**Goal:** Create sustainable, market-based approach

**Actions:**
- ✅ Transition to market-based mechanisms where possible
- ✅ Regional coordination with other New England states
- ✅ Technology innovation incentives (not mandates)
- ✅ Performance-based standards with cost caps

**Potential Savings:** Prevents future increases  
**Difficulty:** Moderate to High  
**Bill Impact:** Maintains competitive rates long-term

## Specific Solutions Ranked by Impact

### 🥇 #1: Cap Mass Save Budget
**Current Cost:** $1.5 billion/year  
**Proposed Cap:** $1.0 billion/year  
**Annual Savings:** $500 million

**Why This Works:**
- Mass Save cost >$250/ton CO₂ vs. $21/ton RGGI market price (12x more expensive)
- Many "efficiency" measures have questionable ROI
- Focus resources on truly cost-effective measures

**Implementation:** Moderate difficulty, requires legislative action

---

### 🥈 #2: Consolidate Solar Programs
**Current Cost:** $800-900 million/year across multiple programs  
**Potential Savings:** $300-400 million/year

**Why This Works:**
- SMART, net metering, and REC purchases overlap
- Above-market compensation no longer needed (solar is cost-competitive)
- Streamlined program reduces administrative costs

**Implementation:** Moderate difficulty, requires DPU and legislative action

---

### 🥉 #3: Reform RPS Multipliers
**Current Cost:** Embedded in rates, estimated $400-500M/year  
**Potential Savings:** $200-300 million/year

**Why This Works:**
- Current multipliers overvalue certain renewable sources
- Market prices have dropped since multipliers were set
- Align incentives with actual clean energy value

**Implementation:** Moderate difficulty, DPU rulemaking with legislative support

---

### #4: Review RGGI Participation
**Current Cost:** $150-200 million/year  
**Potential Savings:** $150-200 million/year (if reformed)

**Why This Works:**
- RGGI costs have risen while benefits to MA are unclear
- Most emission reductions came from coal retirements (would have happened anyway)
- Could negotiate lower caps or transition to more cost-effective mechanisms

**Implementation:** Difficult, requires interstate negotiation

---

### #5: Implement Affordability Metrics
**Current Cost:** $0 (new program)  
**Savings:** Prevents future increases

**Why This Works:**
- No state currently has hard affordability caps
- Would force prioritization of cost-effective programs
- Protects low-income ratepayers

**Implementation:** Easy, legislative action only

---

### #6: Require Transparent Reporting
**Current Cost:** $0 (new program)  
**Savings:** Enables accountability and informed decisions

**Why This Works:**
- Currently no standardized cost-benefit reporting
- Public can't evaluate program effectiveness
- Sunlight is the best disinfectant

**Implementation:** Easy, legislative action only

## Political Feasibility

### What's Happening Now

**Positive Signs:**
- New legislation advancing in MA House addresses affordability
- Would cap Mass Save, scale back mandates, remove "social cost of carbon"
- Explicitly framed as ratepayer relief
- Bipartisan concern about electricity costs

**Challenges:**
- Entrenched interests benefit from current programs
- Some view any reform as "anti-climate"
- Utilities have adapted business models to mandates
- Regional coordination requires multi-state agreement

### Building Support

**Who Benefits from Reform:**
- ✅ All ratepayers (residential, commercial, industrial)
- ✅ Low-income households (disproportionately impacted)
- ✅ Businesses concerned about competitiveness
- ✅ Legislators facing constituent anger over bills

**Messaging Strategy:**
- Frame as "smarter climate policy, not less climate policy"
- Emphasize cost-effectiveness and accountability
- Compare to other states' successful models
- Focus on protecting vulnerable populations
- Show data: current programs cost 12x more per ton CO₂ than alternatives

## Common Questions

### Q: Won't this hurt climate goals?
**A:** No. These reforms make climate policy more cost-effective, not less effective. We can achieve the same emissions reductions at 1/10th the cost through market-based mechanisms and proven technologies.

### Q: What about jobs in the clean energy sector?
**A:** Reform focuses resources on cost-effective measures, which creates more sustainable jobs. Current programs subsidize inefficient approaches that won't survive without mandates.

### Q: Isn't this just about protecting fossil fuels?
**A:** No. The data shows policy costs, not fuel costs, are driving high rates. Natural gas and renewables both need market-based approaches, not above-market mandates.

### Q: Other New England states have similar costs. Why single out MA?
**A:** MA ranks #3 most expensive. While regional coordination is needed, MA can act unilaterally on Mass Save, solar programs, and RPS reforms. These are state decisions.

### Q: Won't utilities fight this?
**A:** Some utilities may prefer the current system where they're guaranteed recovery of program costs. However, reform protects utilities' core business while making them more competitive for new customers.

## Conclusion

Massachusetts' electricity cost crisis is real, but it's also solvable. The problem isn't utility mismanagement—it's legislative mandates that cost far more than necessary to achieve climate goals.

**The good news:** Practical reforms can save billions while maintaining environmental progress. States like Pennsylvania and Ohio prove that market-based approaches work better and cost less.

**The challenge:** Reform requires legislative action, not utility initiatives. Ratepayers must make their voices heard.

**The opportunity:** Pending legislation shows momentum for change. With sustained public pressure and data-driven advocacy, Massachusetts can achieve both affordability and environmental goals.

**The time is now.** Every year of delay costs ratepayers billions more.
