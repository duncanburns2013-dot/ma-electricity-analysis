## 📊 The 8 Visualization Charts

### 1. **Problem Overview** 
Shows the three main drivers of high costs:
- Policy mandates ($4.4B/year)
- Cost growth (+293%)
- Burden on ratepayers (+$1,188/year)

### 2. **Solution Framework**
Three categories of solutions:
- Immediate relief (6-12 months)
- Structural reforms (1-2 years)
- Long-term strategy (3-5 years)

### 3. **Cost Reduction Scenarios**
Step-by-step path from $4.4B to $2.2B:
- Current costs
- After immediate reforms
- After full package
- Target (national average)

### 4. **Bill Impact Analysis**
Shows how reforms affect your bill:
- Current: $204/month
- After immediate reforms: $170/month (-$34)
- After full package: $145/month (-$59)
- US average: $105/month

### 5. **Specific Solutions**
6 detailed solutions ranked by impact:
1. Cap Mass Save Budget ($500M savings)
2. Consolidate Solar Programs ($300-400M)
3. Reform RPS Multipliers ($200-300M)
4. Review RGGI ($150-200M)
5. Affordability Metrics (prevents increases)
6. Transparent Reporting (enables accountability)

### 6. **State Comparisons**
Learn from states that manage costs better:
- Pennsylvania: 14.5¢/kWh (market-based)
- Ohio: 15.2¢/kWh (balanced approach)
- New Hampshire: 26.1¢/kWh (recently reformed)
- Shows what works and what doesn't

### 7. **Implementation Timeline**
Phased approach over 36 months:
- **Phase 1 (0-6 mo):** Quick wins ($200M savings)
- **Phase 2 (6-18 mo):** Major reforms ($1.0B cumulative)
- **Phase 3 (18-36 mo):** Structural changes ($2.2B cumulative)

### 8. **Key Takeaways**
Summary of:
- The problem (policy mandates, no caps)
- The solution (legislative reforms)
- The savings ($600-900/year per household)
- The action (contact legislators, demand transparency)

## 💡 Key Findings

### The Problem
- **$4.4 billion/year** in policy mandates
- **57% higher** than US average
- **29% of every bill** goes to policy charges
- Programs cost **12x more per ton CO₂** than market alternatives

### The Solution
- Legislative reforms can save **$2-3 billion annually**
- Average household saves **$600-900/year**

- Achieves same climate goals at **1/10th the cost**

### The Potential Impact

| Reform Stage | Annual Savings | Household Savings | Rate |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|------|
| Current | $0 | $0 | 27.4¢/kWh |
| Immediate | $800M | $408/year | 24.0¢/kWh |
| Major Reforms | $1.4B | $708/year | 21.5¢/kWh |
| Full Package | $2.2B | $900/year | 20.5¢/kWh |
